      <h3>What does this skill involve?</h3>
      <p>Understanding means engaging with theories and research at a level that goes beyond surface description. It involves grasping why a study was conducted, what it found, and what those findings mean in the context of the broader debate. Summarising is the skill of condensing a study into a concise, accurate account that captures the method, findings, and significance — without copying the original wording. Together, these skills show the reader that you have genuinely engaged with the material, not just listed facts.</p>

        <div class="example-block">
          <div class="example-label">Student Writing</div>
          <div class="example-text">
            <span class="hl-good">Ainsworth et al. (1978) developed the Strange Situation to classify infant attachment styles.</span> <span class="hl-good">In this laboratory procedure, 12- to 18-month-old infants were observed during a series of separations and reunions with their caregiver and a stranger.</span> <span class="hl-good">The study identified three primary attachment styles: secure, insecure-avoidant, and insecure-resistant, with approximately 65% of infants classified as securely attached.</span> <span class="hl-good">These findings provided the first empirical framework for measuring individual differences in attachment, though the artificial laboratory setting may not fully reflect how infants behave in naturalistic contexts.</span>

            <strong>Why this works:</strong> This summary is concise but complete. It names the researchers and year, describes the method in one sentence, states the specific findings with data, and ends with a brief critical comment about the methodology. The reader knows exactly what the study did, found, and means — all in four sentences.

    <!-- Example 2: Weak + improved -->

      <div class="card-header">📖 Example 2: Vague Summary vs. Effective Summary</div>
      <div class="card-body">
        <div class="example-block">
          <div class="example-label">❌ Weak Version</div>
          <div class="example-text">
            <span class="hl-weak">Bowlby did a study on juvenile thieves and found that maternal deprivation was bad for children. This shows that attachment is important.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="example-explanation">
            <strong>Why this is weak:</strong> This summary is too vague. It doesn't explain what Bowlby actually did (the method), what he specifically found (the data), or why the findings matter (the implications). "Bad for children" and "attachment is important" are not academic language and don't demonstrate understanding of the research.
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="example-block" style="margin-top:20px;">
          <div class="example-label">✅ Improved Version</div>
          <div class="example-text">
            <span class="hl-good">Bowlby (1944) conducted a case study of 44 juvenile thieves referred to a child guidance clinic.</span> <span class="hl-good">He found that 14 of the 44 displayed 'affectionless psychopathy' — a lack of empathy and inability to form meaningful relationships — and that 12 of these 14 had experienced prolonged separation from their mothers before the age of two.</span> <span class="hl-good">This led Bowlby to propose his maternal deprivation hypothesis: that continuous emotional care from a mother figure is essential during a critical period for healthy emotional development. However, the retrospective, correlational nature of the study means that other factors — such as the reasons for the separation — may have contributed to the outcomes observed.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="example-explanation">
            <strong>Why this is better:</strong> This version names the method (case study), gives specific data (14 out of 44), defines the key term (affectionless psychopathy), explains the theoretical conclusion (maternal deprivation hypothesis), and offers a critical evaluation. It demonstrates real understanding of the study.

Children adopted before the age of six months showed cognitive development comparable to UK-born controls by age four, whereas those adopted later showed initial delays but significant recovery over time, though some effects of deprivation persisted into adolescence.
