    <div class="page-subtitle">How to cite sources accurately and build a reliable reference list using APA 7th edition.</div>

    <!-- Definition -->
    <div class="definition-box">
      <h3>Why does referencing matter?</h3>
      <p>Referencing is how you show where your ideas and evidence come from. It serves three purposes: it gives credit to the original researchers, it allows the reader to check your sources, and it protects you from plagiarism. In psychology, the standard format is APA 7th edition. Accurate referencing is not just a formatting exercise — it is a core academic skill that demonstrates intellectual honesty and attention to detail. Every factual claim that is not common knowledge needs a citation.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Example 1: Good in-text citations -->
    <div class="card">
      <div class="card-header">📖 Example 1: Effective In-Text Citation</div>
      <div class="card-body">
        <div class="example-block">
          <div class="example-label">Student Writing</div>
          <div class="example-text">
            <span class="hl-good">Bowlby (1969) proposed that infants form a primary attachment to one caregiver, a concept he termed 'monotropy.'</span> <span class="hl-good">This was later supported by Ainsworth et al. (1978), whose Strange Situation paradigm identified distinct patterns of attachment behaviour.</span> However, <span class="hl-good">cross-cultural research has challenged the universality of these categories (Takahashi, 1990; Van IJzendoorn & Kroonenberg, 1988).</span>
          </div>
          <div class="example-explanation">
            <strong>Why this works:</strong> Each claim is supported by a correctly formatted citation. When the author is part of the sentence, the year follows in brackets: "Bowlby (1969) proposed..." When the citation is parenthetical, both author and year go in brackets: "(Takahashi, 1990)." Multiple sources are separated by semicolons. For three or more authors, "et al." is used from the first citation (APA 7th edition rule).

      <div class="card-header">📖 Example 2: Common Referencing Mistakes</div>
      <div class="card-body">
        <div class="example-block">
          <div class="example-label">❌ Incorrect</div>
          <div class="example-text">
            <span class="hl-weak">Research has shown that attachment is important for development.</span> <span class="hl-weak">Bowlby's theory says that children need a primary caregiver (Bowlby, John, 1969).</span> <span class="hl-weak">According to a study, insecure children have more problems later (Hazan & Shaver).</span>
          </div>
          <div class="example-explanation">
            <strong>Three mistakes here:</strong><br>
            1. The first sentence makes a claim with no citation at all — which research? Who found this?<br>
            2. The second citation includes the first name — APA uses surname and year only: (Bowlby, 1969).<br>
            3. The third citation is missing the year — it should be (Hazan & Shaver, 1987). Without the year, the reader cannot locate the source.
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="example-block" style="margin-top:20px;">
          <div class="example-label">✅ Corrected</div>
          <div class="example-text">
            <span class="hl-good">Research consistently demonstrates that early attachment quality influences later emotional development (Bowlby, 1969; Sroufe, 2005).</span> <span class="hl-good">Bowlby's (1969) attachment theory proposes that children are biologically predisposed to form a primary bond with one caregiver.</span> <span class="hl-good">Hazan and Shaver (1987) extended this framework to adult romantic relationships, finding that attachment styles formed in infancy predicted patterns of adult intimacy.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="example-explanation">
            <strong>Why this is correct:</strong> Every claim has a citation. Author surnames are used without first names. Years are always included. When citing two authors in the text, use "and": "Hazan and Shaver (1987)." When citing in brackets, use "&": "(Hazan & Shaver, 1987).

However, Cowan (2001) challenged this estimate, arguing that the true capacity limit is closer to four chunks of information when rehearsal strategies are controlled for. Baddeley and Hitch (1974) advanced the field further by proposing a multi-component working memory model that distinguishes between storage and processing functions. Understanding these capacity limitations has significant practical implications, particularly for educational design and cognitive load management in learning environments (Sweller, 1988).'</p>";
