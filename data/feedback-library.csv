F33,Strong topic sentence (Point),PEEL Structure,"Your paragraph opens with a clear and focused topic sentence that tells the reader exactly what the paragraph will argue.

F34,Topic sentence needs focus (Point),PEEL Structure,"Your paragraph begins too broadly and does not clearly state what the paragraph will argue. For example, writing 'There are many theories about attachment' does not give the reader a specific direction. A stronger topic sentence would be: 'Bowlby's attachment theory suggests that disrupted early bonds can lead to lasting difficulties in emotional regulation.'

F35,Effective use of evidence (Evidence),PEEL Structure,"You support your point with well-chosen evidence that directly strengthens your argument. For example, you cited 'Hazan and Shaver (1987) found that adults who reported insecure attachment in childhood were significantly more likely to describe their romantic relationships as anxious or avoidant.' This is strong because you named the researchers, described the finding specifically, and chose a study that directly supports your topic sentence about attachment and emotional development.","You support your point with well-chosen evidence that directly strengthens your argument.

F36,Evidence needs strengthening (Evidence),PEEL Structure,"Your paragraph makes claims but does not provide sufficient evidence to support them. For example, you wrote 'Research has shown that attachment affects later relationships' without citing a specific study.

F37,Clear explanation and analysis (Explain),PEEL Structure,"Your explanation effectively connects the evidence back to your argument and shows critical thinking. For example, you wrote: 'This finding supports Bowlby's prediction that internal working models formed in infancy shape expectations in later relationships. However, the reliance on retrospective self-report means participants may have reconstructed their childhood experiences through the lens of their current relationship difficulties.' This is excellent because you explained why the evidence matters and then evaluated its limitations.","Your explanation effectively connects the evidence back to your argument and shows critical thinking.

F38,Explanation needs depth (Explain),PEEL Structure,"After presenting your evidence, you moved on without explaining what it means or why it matters. For example, after citing Hazan and Shaver's findings, you simply moved to the next study. Instead, you should explain: Why does this evidence support your point? What does it tell us about the theory? Are there any limitations?

F39,Strong linking sentence (Link),PEEL Structure,"Your paragraph ends with an effective linking sentence that connects back to the essay question and transitions to the next point. For example, you wrote: 'While attachment theory offers a strong framework for understanding emotional development, it does not fully account for the role of peer relationships, which will be examined in the following section.' This works well because it summarises the paragraph's conclusion, acknowledges a limitation, and signals what comes next.","Your paragraph ends with an effective linking sentence that connects back to the essay question and transitions to the next point.

F40,Linking sentence needs work (Link),PEEL Structure,"Your paragraph ends abruptly without linking back to the essay question or transitioning to the next point. Ending with a piece of evidence or a standalone fact leaves the reader without a sense of closure. A strong linking sentence should do two things: (1) briefly restate how the paragraph's argument answers the essay question, and (2) signal the direction of the next paragraph.
